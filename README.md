# Local Network Port Scanning with Nmap

This project demonstrates how I scanned my local network to discover active devices and identify open ports using Nmap. I began by installing Nmap on my Windows system and used the `ipconfig` command to find my local IP address and subnet range. With this information, I ran a TCP SYN scan using the command `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24` to probe all devices on the network. The scan revealed several hosts and their corresponding open ports. I documented the IP addresses and open ports found, researched common services running on those ports, and identified any potential security risks based on the results. Finally, I saved the output of the scan to a text file (`scan_result.txt`) for analysis and reference. This project was done purely for educational purposes on my own network.
